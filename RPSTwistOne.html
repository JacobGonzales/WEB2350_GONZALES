            <h3>The Game: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
            <p>
                You will be playing against a Computer. <br>
                Here are the rules: <br><br>
                Rock beats Scissors <br>
                Paper beats Rock <br>
                Scissors beats Paper <br>
                Anything Else Will Result in a Tie.<br>
                <br>
                The Twist:
                <br><br>
                Perfect your ability to think fast by trying to win, lose, or tie versus the computerâ€™s decision. For example, with a countdown clock running, the computer shows you it's selection first (and tells you if you won or lost).  If it shows you paper and tells you to win, you would then have to choose scissors (to win). However if the computer shows you paper and tells you to lose, you must choose rock (in order to "lose" and get points). It will take quick thinking and nerves of steel! You will be fighting against the clock and a tireless computer foe!  Points are collected for correct selections and (doubly) penalized for incorrect ones. 
                <br><br>
                You will have 30 Seconds. Timer Starts when you press on any of the pictures below...
                
<!--                Incorporate a high score display as well, and notify the user if they achieved the high score at the end of the game.<br>-->
